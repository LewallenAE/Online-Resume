    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>I am a captive insurance broker, with 3 years of experience, holding valid life and health insurance licenses in all 50 states and Washington D.C.<br/>
    I'm looking to utilize my knowledge of mathematics, statistics, computers, and full stack development to propel myself out of the sales industry and<br/>
    into tech.</p>
    <p>Currently I am working on developing these skills through self-paced online sources. Even though this has come about later in my life, I have always been interested in computers / computer science,<br/>
    web development, technology, software development, and applications. Looking back and reflecting on my younger self, I can still remember using the old HTML on Angelfire, back when everything was Yahoo<br/>
    and Hotmail. This was the first time I encountered a Japanese manga or comic book by the now incredibly famous Dragon Ball created by Akira Toriyama R.I.P. Nothing was more amazing than<br/>
    the computer. Doom computer games, chatting on the internet, all of the information at my fingertips, I could learn almost anything I wanted. And today, well now it's even bigger, the fact<br/>
    of the matter is, the internet is here to stay, and it has made the world all the better. Sure there are some downsides such as information overload, and internet bullying, which one day<br/>
    maybe we can figure a way to get rid of it. Nevertheless, the internet provides access to individuals that otherwise, for a lack of a better phrase, wouldn't have access to things such as<br/>
    education, jobs, food delivery, medical needs, and many more. The internet has opened doors, and the internet has been made possible because of computers. Yes indeed, computer science is<br/>
    where it's at. Computer science is the next big breakthrough. Increases in computing power means more and grander things. As a kid I dreamed of virtual and augmented reality, and guess what?<br/>
    Now it's here, amazing! I wish to blend mathematical concepts with computer science and eventually AI. AI is the next evolution in computer science in my opinion. </p>
    <p>So why is computer science and technology so important to me? Well, aside from being completely enthralled with computers since I was young, and computer allowing me to further my education<br/>
    and obtain my bachelor's degree, earlier this year something unexpected happened. While working full-time as an insurance producer and field underwriter, I was finally closing in on one of my<br/>
    dreams, to complete my bachelor degree. I needed to complete 4 more classes which consisted of Inventory Models and Systems, Operational Simulation, Game Theory and Decision Models, and the <br/>
    final Senior Seminar culminating into a capstone project paper, and presentation. However, on March 26, 2024, I suffered a sudden cardiac arrest. I remember calling 911 after feeling a random<br/>
    pain in my back and chest that felt like fire. Upon arriving the EMTs strapped on a 12 lead and promptly told me I need to get to the hospital pronto. While in the ambulance they gave me two<br/>
    nitroglycerin for the pain. Shortly after that second dose, I felt my heart stop. My vision faded to black, and I remember calling out, "Hey can you guys hear me!?" Hear me, hear me, hear me,<br/>
    echoed as I fell dead. The EMTs said my heart stopped beating for around 6 minutes and they brought me back using an AED. Apparently, after 4 minutes brain damage starts to occur, and your <br/>
    chance of survival quickly declines every minute thereafter. Weird and very vivid "dreams" overtook me while in this state. I awoke abruptly sitting up, like The Undertaker during the 90s <br/>
    wrestling matches, my vision bobbing around. "Anthony chill out, hang on, hold up!" I heard the EMTs crying out. As my vision regained focus, and oddly not out of breath or gasping for air,<br/>
    I noticed their ghostly looking faces. 
    <p>This would be the first time I had a ride in a helicopter, albeit, lying on my back the whole time. Upon arrival emergency personnel swiftly whisked me into the emergency room at Carondelet<br/>
    Medical Center in Tucson, AZ. A sadness quickly came over me as they cut the Nirvana hoodie my wife had bought me not more than 12 hours prior. All in all I spent a couple days in the hospital<br/>
    and on the first day underwent emergency life-saving surgery. The electrical production system of my heart had gone haywire for unknown reasons. I now had an ICD implanted in my chest. I was tired<br/>
    all the time, I felt foggy, I was mandated no driving for 6 months, and my arm was plastered to my side for 3 months since I couldn't move it. Any type of jerking motion or moving the wrong way <br/>
    could potentially rip out the leads spelling immediate disaster for me. Despite my newfound disability and obstacles, I persevered. Finding new ways to manage my time, and working like the one-armed<br/>
    bandit. I focused on getting through classes, using the voice-over on my phone, dictating speech-to-text for discussions assignments, papers, and even copy and pasting formulae into Excel for simulations<br/>
    I managed to keep my GPA up, and complete all of my classes. You can do what you set your mind to. I never wanted to give up. I had already done that when I was younger, when I didn't have my head<br/>
    on straight. There was no more time for excuses, and no more time for lollygagging. I had to suck it up, man-up, and make the most of it, it was either do-or-die, and I chose to do as I had already<br/>
    died. Had it not been for the computer which operates my ICD, nor the developers who created the software sending instructions to the unit, I wouldn't be alive. I quite literally owe my life to<br/>
    computers, computer science, and technology. Thank you for reading</p>
